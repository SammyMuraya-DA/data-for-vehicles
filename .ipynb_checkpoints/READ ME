# Data for Vehicles

## Description
Data for Vehicles is a data analysis project focused on exploring and visualizing vehicle data,
including attributes such as horsepower, width, length, fuel type, number of cylinders, and log price.
The project leverages Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform data transformations and
generate insightful visualizations, including bubble charts and count plots.
